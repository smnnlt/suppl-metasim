# List of changes

The second version of the preprint manuscript contains the following changes:

* New data for cycling by Wahl et al. (2017)
* Recalculated %VO2(MLSS) data by Weber. In a personal communication, the author stated that the %VO2(MLSS) data given (which we used in the first version of our preprint) were not measured but calculated using an equation similar to our Eq. 7. Since we could not reproduce the calculated %VO2(MLSS data) provided by Weber (2003), we recalculated the data according to Eq. 7 of the preprint.
* Additional data by Hauser (2012). As we mentioned in the first version of the preprint, the data in Hauser et al. (2014) are a subset of the data shown in Hausers Ph.D. thesis (2012). After we posted the preprint, Hauser provided us access to the full data set of his thesis. After we noted inconsistencies between the provided data and the data presented in the dissertation, the author acknowledged data management errors during the preparation of the thesis and provided us with a corrected data set based on the original raw data, which we now use for our analysis. Along with the corrected data set, the author identified four individuals for which he could not reproduce the data (P29, P35, P53, P54 of his work). We excluded these cases from our analysis.
* In the light of the new data, we can make stronger statements regarding the validity of the model for cycling data. 
* Included link to a document containing a detailed derivation of Eq. 6
* Minor rewording in the abstract
