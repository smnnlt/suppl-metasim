# Raw data for the manuscript "Simulation of Steady State Energy Metabolism in Cycling and Running"

The raw data underlying the manuscript is available via the [data.csv](https://github.com/smnnlt/suppl-metasim/blob/master/data/data.csv) file.

It contains the following columns:
- **id**: unique id for all data points included in the analysis
- **vo2max**: maximum oxygen uptake in ml/min/kg. For details on parameter assessment see Table 1 in the manuscript.
- **vlamax**: maximum rate of lactate accumulation in mmol/l/s. For details on parameter assessment see Table 1 in the manuscript.
- **vo2_per**: fractional utilization of the maximum oxygen uptake at MLSS/LT. For details on parameter assessment see Table 1 in the manuscript.
- **source**: data source (first author and year of publication/conducting)
- **det_AT**: test procedure for assessing or approximating the MLSS. "clt" stands for constant load test followed by the duration, "get_4mmol" means onset of blood lactate during and graded incremental exercise test.
- **det_perVO2**: test procedure for determining the oxygen uptake at the MLSS/LT. Either "measured", "calculated", or "unknown".
- **sex**: sex of the athlete
